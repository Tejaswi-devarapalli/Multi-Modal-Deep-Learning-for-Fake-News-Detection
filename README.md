**About project**

In this project, we will build a multi-modal deep learning framework for fake news (tweets) detection on social media by using both textual (tweets) and visual inputs (images). This proposed model aims to deal with the automatic detection of manipulation and misuse in Web multimedia content, which lays the basis for a future generation of tools that could assist media professionals in the process of social media information verification.

I used upto 10000 rows froms a large-scale multimodal fake news dataset consisting of over 1 million samples containing text, image, metadata, and comments data from a highly diverse set of resources. Each data sample consists of multiple labels, allowing users to utilize the dataset for 2-way, 3-way, and 6- way classification.

The goal of this project is to build a 2-way classification deep learning model with two inputs and one output using TensorFlow Functional API with.
